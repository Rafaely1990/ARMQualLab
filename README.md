# ARMQualLab

Introduction
============
The ARM Qual lab is designed as a self-teaching guide to allow users to able to follow the level courses and learn through the process of creating solutions based on scenario requirements. This lab provides the correct answers to the scenario solutions in order for the user's to be able to compare the ones they build for the purposes of validation and self-assessments. The scenario solutions are real customer solutions from experts in the field. This would enable users of the Qual Lab to quickly ramp up to be delivery experts in the technology set. The level matrix below will provide a guideline on what service delivery readiness will occur with each level value. The ultimate goal of the Qual lab is to enable people to quickly onboard a technology and be comfortable facing customer specific scenarios with regard to the technology.

Level 100:
==========
At level 100, if successfully completed, the user should have the skills to shadow an ARM engagement. The following scenarios are covered at the following level:
* Create a basic template to provision a storage account
* Understand the difference between ASM and ARM deployment models. 
* Understand best practices in creating and designing ARM templates. 
* Understand the structure of ARM templates and the relationship between the components. 
* Basic understanding of some ARM template functions.

Level 200:
==========
At level 200 if successfully completed, the user should have the skills to be able to participate in an ARM engagement as a secondary role to another primary resource. The following scenarios are covered at this level:
* Understand resource provisioning in sequence through dependencies. 
* Understand the different ways to pass parameters to an ARM template

Level 300:
==========
At level 300 if successfully completed the user should have the skills to be able to conduct a standard ARM engagement as a primary role. 
The following scenarios are covered at this level:
* Standard resource deployments
* Advanced understanding of ARM template functions.
* Requirement gathering and translation to ARM Template
* Quickly leverage and consume canned templates provided by the Azure GitHub template repository. 

Level 400:
==========
At this level the user should have the following additional capabilities to that of Level 300:
* Able to discern resource properties value by looking up and navigating ARM schemas.
* Create advance template linking and be able to troubleshoot failures in secondary templates. 
* Leverage advance template provisioning with dynamic parameter injections. 
* Create automation code to be able to orchestrate provisioning of resources leveraging dynamic parameter injections 

ARM Qual Lab scaling out:
========================= 
One of the goals of this Qual lab is to create pairings between the users who undergo the qualifications level and the experts who have already mastered the levels. This allows the experts to provide support and custom feedback as the user(s) moves up the qualification levels. This can be a cyclical process in which users themselves become experts to assist the new waves of users. This will allow a large set of users to interact with each other at any levels. Here is an example of a pairing scenario:
 
A level 300 level can provide assistance and mentoring to any level 100 users. We are targeting the ability of any level user to provide guidance to any users two level below the user's current level. At level 400, the user can be paired with any users from the 100-400 levels. 
 
Developing Content:
=================== 
Over time as we onboard more users, we will continuously update the level requirements to reflect changing features of the technology set as well as any coverage gap that may exist at any particular level. Users undergoing the levels are encourage to provide feedback on the effectiveness of the qual lab to be able to fine tune the content. 
 
Delivery Model:
===============
We plan to create and deliver this solution in phases.
Phase 1: Fill out Level 100-400 level scenarios with external content, validation tests and answers. 
Phase 2: Create a program of continuous validation between users of any levels. Track users as they master each level as well as on engagements in which they are leveraging the technology sets. Expand validation tests at higher levels to 1:1 assessments of capabilities.
